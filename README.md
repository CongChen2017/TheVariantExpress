# Variant Expression in Disease

Hackathon team: Cong Chen, Matthew Dapas, Joseph Subida, Octavious Talbot, Chad Travis, Ye Wang

Genetic variants are abundant and are expected to contribute to risk of disease for an individual. Previous genetic association studies have successfully identified common genetic variants associated with risk for disease, these studies are not practical for searching on a massive scale or viewing association testing for expression of certain genes.  

VARDIS is a new pipeline that creates association testing between variants in RNA-Seq data and expression analysis, in order to create leads for research. 

# What is a Structural Variant?

Structural Variant is a region of DNA 1 kb and larger in size and can include inversions and balanced translocations or genomic imbalances.  These imbalances are referred to as copy number variants (CNVs), which often overlap duplications.  In addition to well-known sporadic chromosomal microdeletion syndromes and Mendelian diseases, many common complex traits including autism and schizophrenia can result from CNVs.


# What's the problem?

With the amount of genetic factors, it is very difficult to link a mechanism to casusality 

Difficult to link causality and a mechanism  (driving genes)
Can have a variant that we know is pathogenic but not know what pathway through which it acts
If you have overexpression and know a gene drives it.. you may not know what causes the change in expression
Corresponding variation and
